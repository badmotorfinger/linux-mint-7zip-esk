# 7zip-type integration for Linux Mint

I searched far and wide for this and couldn't find a solution anywhere. Hope this helps someone. If so, leave me a star! Thanks.

# Installation

For this to work, you'll need to install peazip

`sudo apt install peazip`

Then copy the `nemo_action` files to `$HOME/.local/share/nemo/actions` and then enjoy the following context menus.
